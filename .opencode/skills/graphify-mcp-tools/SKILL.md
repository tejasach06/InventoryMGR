# graphify-mcp-tools

MCP server for querying the project's knowledge graph (built by graphify).

## Available Tools

### graph_search
Full-text search across all graph nodes (functions, classes, modules) with optional BFS/DFS context expansion.

Parameters:
- `query` (required): search text
- `top_k`: max results (default: 10)
- `type`: filter by node type — "function", "class", "module"
- `repo`: filter by repository name
- `context_depth`: BFS/DFS expansion depth from top results (0 = no expansion, default: 0)
- `context_mode`: "bfs" (broad context) or "dfs" (trace specific path). Default: "bfs"

Use when: finding symbols, locating definitions, exploring what exists. Set context_depth > 0 to also see connected nodes around the results.

### graph_impact
Blast radius analysis — find everything that depends on a symbol (downstream) and everything it depends on (upstream).

Parameters:
- `symbol` (required): symbol name or ID
- `direction`: "upstream", "downstream", or "both" (default: "both")
- `max_depth`: BFS depth limit (default: 3)
- `include_tests`: include test files (default: false)

Use when: assessing change risk, understanding dependencies before refactoring.

### graph_path
Shortest path between two nodes in the knowledge graph (Dijkstra).

Parameters:
- `from` (required): source node name or ID
- `to` (required): target node name or ID
- `max_depth`: max hops (default: 10)
- `edge_types`: filter by relationship types

Use when: understanding how two symbols are connected, tracing call chains.

### graph_explain
Full detail on a single node: properties, edges, community membership, centrality metrics.

Parameters:
- `symbol` (required): node name or ID
- `include_code`: also return the file outline (default: false)

Use when: deep-diving into a specific symbol, understanding its role in the architecture.

### graph_community
List all nodes belonging to a specific community.

Parameters:
- `community_id` (required): community ID or name

Use when: exploring module boundaries, understanding which symbols are clustered together.

### graph_hotspots
Most connected nodes in the graph — architectural hotspots / god nodes.

Parameters:
- `top_n`: number of results (default: 10)
- `metric`: ranking metric — "degree", "in_degree", "out_degree", "betweenness" (default: "degree")

Use when: identifying critical symbols, finding architectural bottlenecks, prioritizing refactoring targets.

### graph_outline
File outline: function signatures, class definitions, imports — without reading the full source.

Parameters:
- `file_path` (required): relative path to file
- `format`: "markdown" or "json" (default: "markdown")

Use when: getting a quick overview of a file's structure.

### graph_status
Graph metadata: node/edge counts, repos included, build timestamp.

No parameters.

Use when: checking if the graph is available and up to date.

## Best Practices

1. **Prefer graph tools over grep/find** — graph_search uses indexed ranking and understands symbol types.
2. **Check impact before refactoring** — run graph_impact on any symbol you plan to modify.
3. **Use graph_path to trace connections** — faster and more accurate than manually following imports.
4. **Use graph_hotspots to find god nodes** — high-degree nodes are architectural risks.
5. **Use context_depth for broad exploration** — set context_depth=2 on graph_search to see the neighborhood around results.
6. **Read GRAPH_REPORT.md** at `graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md` for architecture overview, god nodes, and community structure.
7. **Keep the graph current** — after code changes, run `graphify update .` to rebuild (AST-only, no API cost).
